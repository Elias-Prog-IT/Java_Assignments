# Text Based Adventure Game.
This was one of my first java assignments in my java class at Link√∂ping University, making a text-based adventure game.
I got to admit, during the process of making the text-based game, my assignment partner and I hated the assignment. 
It was a struggle, which kept me and my assignment partner up several nights during the class progression. 
But looking back now, I got to admit that I am proud of the finished product! =)
