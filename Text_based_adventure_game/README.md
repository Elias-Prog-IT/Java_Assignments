# Text Based Adventure Game.
This text-based adventure game is one of the first Java assignments. I got to admit, during the process of making the text-based game, my assignment partner and I hated the work. It was a struggle, which kept my assignment partner and me up several nights during the class progression. But looking back now, I got to admit that I am proud of the finished product!
